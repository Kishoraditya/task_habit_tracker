# Future Plan for Task & Habit Tracker

This document outlines the roadmap and feature enhancements for the Task & Habit Tracker project. The plan is divided into several phases, each building on the previous one to incrementally improve functionality, user experience, and scalability. All features and integrations leverage free and open-source tools whenever possible.

## Phase 1: Production-Ready Deployment & Basic Functionality

**Goal:** Establish a solid production foundation with hosting, CI/CD, and basic email capabilities.

### Key Tasks

- **Hosting & Deployment:**
  - Deploy the current FastAPI application using free hosting platforms (e.g., Render).
  - Configure GitHub (or GitLab) for source control and integrate GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
  - Use environment variables and simple configuration files for production settings.

- **Basic Infrastructure:**
  - Use SQLite initially (or PostgreSQL for a production database) with SQLAlchemy.
  - Set up a simple session management with FastAPI’s SessionMiddleware.
  - Ensure static files (CSS, images) are served correctly.

- **Email Integration (Future-Ready):**
  - Add Zoho Mail free plan configuration in `.env` for future email notifications.
  - Document future integration steps for sending emails (e.g., using FastAPI-Mail).

- **Documentation & Monitoring:**
  - Create a detailed README with deployment instructions.
  - Set up basic logging (using Python’s logging) and monitor through Render’s dashboard.
  - (Optional) Use Terraform for future DNS/SSL management (skipped for now).

## Phase 2: Enhanced UI/UX and Offline/Decentralized Data

**Goal:** Improve the look and feel of the application and add offline capabilities.

### Key Tasks_2

- **UI/UX Overhaul:**
  - Redesign using a retro, notebook-style theme with open-source CSS frameworks (e.g., PaperCSS, Tailwind CSS).
  - Improve responsiveness to ensure a great mobile experience.
  - Refine landing, login, registration, and dashboard pages for a cohesive user experience.

- **Progressive Web App (PWA):**
  - Convert the web app into a PWA to allow offline access and caching.
  - Use service workers, local storage, or IndexedDB (e.g., via localForage) for local data persistence.

- **Decentralized Data Options:**
  - Explore options to store user data locally (e.g., using browser-based storage).
  - Investigate experimental integrations with decentralized storage solutions like IPFS for enhanced privacy.

- **Python Mobile Framework Exploration:**
  - Evaluate frameworks such as Kivy or BeeWare for potential native mobile applications.

## Phase 3: Rich List Management & Collaborative Features

**Goal:** Expand task management with rich content formatting and collaboration tools.

### Key Tasks_3

- **Multiple Lists & Rich Text:**
  - Allow users to create and manage multiple lists (personal, work, projects, etc.).
  - Integrate a rich text editor (e.g., Quill, CKEditor, or Markdown support) for task descriptions.
  - Enable basic formatting like checkboxes, headings, and embedded links.

- **Collaboration & Sharing:**
  - Implement sharing features that let users share lists with others.
  - Develop role-based permissions (read, write, admin) for collaborative list editing.
  - Incorporate real-time updates via WebSockets or Socket.IO for shared list changes.
  - Add notifications for shared changes and collaborative events.

## Phase 4: AI/ML & Intelligent Task Organization

**Goal:** Leverage artificial intelligence to provide insights and automated task management.

### Key Tasks_4

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
  - Integrate open-source NLP libraries (spaCy, NLTK) or lightweight models from Hugging Face.
  - Automatically categorize and tag tasks based on content.
  - Develop a summarization tool for daily tasks, reading lists, and diary-style entries.

- **Intelligent Task Suggestions:**
  - Use machine learning to suggest next-day tasks or optimized schedules.
  - Implement sentiment analysis for mood tracking and habit formation insights.
  - Consider a chatbot or assistant feature that uses conversational AI to help plan tasks.

- **AI-Driven Planning Tools:**
  - Provide structured to-dos and recommendations based on historical task data.
  - Use data visualization (charts and dashboards) to highlight trends and insights.

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Task Management & Scheduling

**Goal:** Introduce complex task relationships, scheduling, and visual management tools.

### Key Tasks_5

- **Hierarchical Tasks & Dependencies:**
  - Add support for parent-child relationships, subtasks, and task dependencies.
  - Allow users to assign priority levels, deadlines, and reminders to tasks.

- **Calendar Integration & Scheduling:**
  - Integrate calendar views (using FullCalendar or similar) for due dates and recurring events.
  - Build a Kanban board or Gantt chart view for project management.
  - Integrate with third-party calendars (Google, Microsoft, Apple) via APIs.

- **Recurring and Location-Based Tasks:**
  - Implement features for recurring tasks and future task scheduling.
  - Consider adding location-based reminders and timezone-aware calendar functionalities.

## Phase 6: Gamification, Social Integration & Behavioral Analytics

**Goal:** Increase user engagement through gamification and social features while providing deep self-analytics.

### Key Tasks_6

- **Gamification Elements:**
  - Introduce badges, streaks, leaderboards, and achievement systems.
  - Create challenges or quests to motivate daily or weekly task completions.

- **Social Integration:**
  - Enable social logins (OAuth with Google, Facebook, etc.) and community features.
  - Build a social feed or forum where users can share progress and tips.
  - Integrate messaging or comment features for collaborative tasks.

- **Advanced Analytics:**
  - Implement behavioral analytics to track productivity trends and psychological patterns.
  - Develop detailed dashboards with insights, graphs, and personalized recommendations.
  - Use AI to offer actionable insights for habit improvement and productivity optimization.
